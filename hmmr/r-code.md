The complete R code for every analysis, example, figure, etc., can be
downloaded below. Note that the R code was extracted with <code>knitr::purl</code>
from the source code of our book. The resulting files include also code
that is not visible in the book (e.g. when creating a plot, or setting chunk and
other options).
